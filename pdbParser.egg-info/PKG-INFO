Description: It's a Protein Data Bank (.pdb) files manipulation package that is mainly developed to parse and load, duplicate, manipulate and create pdb files.
        A full description of a pdb file can be found here: http://deposit.rcsb.org/adit/docs/pdb_atom_format.html
        pdbParser atoms configuration can be visualized by vmd software (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/) by simply pointing 'VMD_PATH' global variable to the exact path of vmd executable, and using 'visualize' method.
        At any time and stage of data manipulation, a pdb file of all atoms or a subset of atoms can be exported to a pdb file.
